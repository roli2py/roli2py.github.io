## Worth to mention

### Learning materials

#### Math

If you want to understand (not just to blindly trust and memorize formulas) of the various themes from the math then check this project: [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com).

Grant Sanderson, the author of the "[3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com)" project, using the audio-visual approach to provide the fundamental ideas of, for example, the linear algebra or calculus. The project doesn't give you theoremas, axioms or properties, but effectively boosts a further learn. I'm highly recommending this project if you're searching a good starting point.

Thank you, Grant Sanderson, for making these all useful (and cool) videos!
