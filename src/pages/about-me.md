## About Me

My name is Roman. I'm 18 years old. I'm from Ukraine. I'm a software developer.

In free time, I'm developing the LLM applications and "Telegram" bots to solve my real-life problems. Also, I like to learn new programming languages like C++ or Rust. For now, I'm interested in AI.

### Primary programming languages
- Python
- JavaScript

### How I meet a programming
In 11, I started to interest in scripting of simple `bat`s that open a game or a program. Then I understood that I want to go further so I started to learn Python. It was hard for me because I didn't expect that it's not so easy and, consequently, I dropped this idea. When I was 14, I felt that I can't without a creation this all IT stuffs and I continued to learn Python. Now, I continue to develop projects and improve myself.
